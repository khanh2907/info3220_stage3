\section*{Changes to Stage 3 code }

In order to extend the code into Stage 3 I had to make some changes to the existing code.

\subsection*{\hyperlink{class_config_reader}{Config\+Reader} }

The \hyperlink{class_config_reader}{Config\+Reader} class was extended to accomodate for additional variables in the configuration file.

\subsection*{Ball-\/\+Brick Collision Bug }

I discovered that the collision logic in the base code was incorrect as it was not detecting the correct sides. If the ball its the top of the brick is will continue to go through the brick, the brick would lose all its life in one hit. To fix this, I had to rewrite their collision logic.

\subsection*{Box Size Bug }

There was a bug where the box width and height were mixed up. This was fixed.

\section*{Design Pattern }

I chose to use the Strategy Design Pattern. This can be seen in the \hyperlink{class_power_up}{Power\+Up}, \hyperlink{class_ball_power_bonus}{Ball\+Power\+Bonus}, \hyperlink{class_ball_size_bonus}{Ball\+Size\+Bonus} and \hyperlink{class_extra_life}{Extra\+Life} classes.

\section*{Extension }

For the extension, I implemented Power\+Ups and Levels.

Power\+Ups will give the ball more size or power. There is also an extra life powerup.

Levels are generated randomly based on the current level. More bricks are generated as the player gets to a higher level.

These extensions can be switched off and on.
